# Compulign

The CompuLign computer driven alignment tool as developed by L. J. Haskell was designed and built as a multi-functional test device to help radio hobbyists align antique and vintage radios and vintage audio equipment. The design is based on one Arduino Nano micro controller as the main processor plus 2 frequency generation modules based on the AD9850 frequency generator chip. There are 4 outputs and 1 input accessed via BNC type connectors. The functions of the device are:

1. A sine wave generator of 1 volt P-P with output frequency from 1 Hz to 40 MHz set in steps of 1 Hz.
2. A square wave generator of 5 volts P-P with the same frequency range
3. An RF generator of 1 volt P-P with a frequency range of 20 KHz to 40 MHz AM modulated from 0-100% by the sine wave generator output.
4. An RF sweep generator with above output and frequency range that can be swept at multiple rates up to about 50 Hz.
5. A sweep voltage output generating a ramp voltage that can be used to drive an oscilloscope X-axis for a sweep alignment display
6. An input via BNC connector to measure the radio response during sweeps which allows for an internal display of the response displayed on the LCD screen thus eliminating the need for an oscilloscope.
